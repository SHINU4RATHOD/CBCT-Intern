Perform differencing (seasonal and/or regular) to stationarize the data if necessary.
1. why we are using 12 value while diffrencing

2. while in bulding model we are fitting on sales data not on diffrenced stationarized data  
train, test = df['sales'][:train_size], df['sales'][train_size:]
# Fit SARIMA model on training data
model = SARIMAX(train, order=(p, d, q), seasonal_order=(P, D, Q, s))
sarima_result = model.fit()





Note: while partianing the data in test data there should atleast 12month or 1year data if quaterly data 4month data there should be in test
